\begin{abstract}

On the DARPA Cyber Assured Systems Engineering (CASE) program, our team has developed BriefCASE, an open-source model-based engineering environment for cyber-resilient system design.  BriefCASE is comprised of tools that emit evidence of correctness that is maintained by the framework and can be used to substantiate assurance claims.  
In this paper, we describe hierarchical cyber-resiliency assurance patterns, which BriefCASE instantiates with the system under development. Evidence collected by the framework is automatically evaluated in the resulting assurance case to determine whether cyber-resiliency goals have been acceptably satisfied.
