\begin{abstract}

\end{abstract}

% Include short CASE / BriefCASE overview
\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}
\input{introduction}

% Include DMILS - compare/contrast
% or integrate this section with Intro if short on space
\section{Related Work}
\label{sec:related-work}
\input{related-work}

% Do we present this in graphical GSN, or Resolute, or both?
% Start high-level, go as low-level as space allows
% Don't go into too much detail of model argument, instead refer to Destion paper
% Spend more time on implementation argument?
\section{Assurance Pattern}
\label{sec:assurance-pattern}
\input{assurance-pattern}

% Show how pattern is used in BriefCASE
% Include pattern library (aadl contribution)
% Auto insert of top-level goal
% Instantiation
% Evaluation of external artifacts
